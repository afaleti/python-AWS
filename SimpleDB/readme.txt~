SimpleDB via Python
by: Sorin Vatasoiu Jr (sorin.vatasoiu@gmail.com)

Steps prior to using these scripts:
1. Install python 2.7 (not python 3.0+, because boto does not work for that version)
2. Install boto, a python package/API for interfacing with any Amazon web service
3. Make an AWS account

For the next two steps, go to https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials
(please leave a single space between the colon and the key!!)
4. Set your Access Key ID to the first line of the keys.txt file 
5. Set your Secret Access Key to the second line of the keys.txt file


These scripts can be run directly from the terminal/command prompt or from the python shell
As of 7/16/2013, all functions assume your intended domain is the first domain retrieved by the get_all_domains() function. This can be changed.



Example Terminal commands:
add new row (no spaces in keys or values!)
$ python addItem.py -n beagleboneTest --keys=["key1","key2","key3"] --values=[1,2,3]

retrieve all rows
$ python sdbGetAll.py

get specific item by name
$ python getItem.py -n <item name>

(steps below are for use with BeagleBone)
Setup for BeagleBone
1. Install Python packages: py_compile, distutils, etc. Angstrom is missing a lot of these "standard" libraries...
2. Install Boto (AWS driver for Python)
3. Make file in PythonFiles with code


Setup
$ cd /media/BEAGLEBONE/PythonFiles/
$ x11vnc -bg -o %HOME/.x11vnc.log.%VNCDISPLAY -auth /var/run/gdm/auth-for-gdm*/database -display :0
